ou're encountering a common and frustrating issue with Redis Cluster: commands like DEL, FLUSHALL, and FLUSHDB behave differently in a cluster setup compared to standalone Redis instances. Let's break down why this happens and how to work around it.

Understanding Redis Cluster's Data Distribution

Sharding: Redis Cluster distributes data across multiple nodes (shards) using a hash function. When you write a key, Redis calculates the hash of that key, and based on the hash, determines which node should store the data.

No Single Point of Truth: Because data is spread across multiple nodes, no single node has knowledge of all the keys. This contrasts with standalone Redis, where one server holds all data.

Command Scope: This distribution has a significant impact on how certain commands work:

DEL <key>: Works only on keys present on the specific node where the command was issued. If your key is on a different node, it won't be deleted.

FLUSHDB: This command deletes all data in the current database (default is database 0) only on the node where the command is issued. It doesn't affect other nodes in the cluster.

FLUSHALL: This command deletes all data from all databases only on the node where the command was issued. It doesn't affect other nodes in the cluster.

Why Deletion Isn't Happening as Expected

DEL is Node-Specific: If you connect to a specific Redis node in the cluster and issue DEL <key>, and the key was hashed to a different node, then DEL will not find the key and does not have any impact.

FLUSHDB / FLUSHALL are Node-Specific: If you issue these commands while connected to any one specific node in the cluster, it only clears data on that single node. The rest of the cluster remains unchanged.

Solutions and Best Practices

Use DEL with the Correct Node (or a Cluster-Aware Client):

Find the correct node:

Use the CLUSTER KEYSLOT <key> command to determine which hash slot and thus which node contains the key.

Connect to that specific node using a client that supports cluster mode.

Use cluster-aware clients: Some Redis clients (e.g., Lettuce, Jedis with cluster support) are aware of the hash slots and can intelligently route the DEL command to the correct node. In Spring Boot, you should be using a connection factory that supports this. If you are using Jedis, you need to configure the client for cluster mode.

Example (with a cluster-aware client in spring boot):

redisTemplate.delete(key); // This should route to the correct node
Use code with caution.
Java
Use FLUSHDB/FLUSHALL Correctly (Carefully):

Avoid in Production: In most real-world scenarios, FLUSHALL is dangerous in a cluster setup. It can cause data loss, and due to sharding data loss across cluster can be hard to debug and manage. Instead of FLUSHALL, consider a proper delete operation for your use case.

For test and dev environments: Use FLUSHDB or FLUSHALL only if you really want to clear all data across the whole cluster. This requires special handling:

Loop through all nodes: Use client library of your choice which allows you to connect to each node, and run FLUSHDB (or FLUSHALL) in turn.

Example

Use code with caution.
Java
// Use redis template to connect and send FLUSHDB command to every node.
Set<String> clusterNodes =redisTemplate.getConnectionFactory().getClusterConnection().clusterGetNodes().stream()
.map(RedisClusterNode::getHost).collect(Collectors.toSet());
clusterNodes.forEach(node-> {
LettuceConnectionFactory lettuceConnectionFactory= new LettuceConnectionFactory(new RedisStandaloneConfiguration(node, 6379));
lettuceConnectionFactory.afterPropertiesSet();
RedisTemplate<String,Object> redisTemplate1= new RedisTemplate<>();
redisTemplate1.setConnectionFactory(lettuceConnectionFactory);
redisTemplate1.afterPropertiesSet();
redisTemplate1.getConnectionFactory().getConnection().flushDb();
lettuceConnectionFactory.destroy();
});
```

Avoid KEYS * on Production Clusters: The command KEYS * can severely impact the performance in big production setup as this command fetches all the keys. Instead use it in test environments.

Think About Data Modeling and Deletion:

If you find yourself frequently deleting large amounts of data, consider more strategic data modeling and deletion strategies. You might also want to think about setting expiry on data.

In summary

Redis Cluster is Different: Understand that commands work differently in clusters than in standalone Redis instances.

Node-Specific Behavior: Most commands like DEL and flush commands operate within the scope of individual nodes, not across the whole cluster.

Use Cluster-Aware Clients: Ensure your Redis client is configured correctly for cluster mode.

Careful use of FLUSHALL: Avoid FLUSHALL in production. Use targeted deletions as much as possible.

Test Environments: FLUSHDB and FLUSHALL can be useful in test environments, but always with caution.

By being aware of these issues and the solutions, you'll be able to work with Redis Cluster more effectively and avoid the confusion caused by inconsistent behavior.
